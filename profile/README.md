# Alexis' 20 Games Challenge

Hello! This is my organisation for organising (surprise surprise) for the 20 Games Challenge,
a list of 20 games and resources for making one's own versions of popular games as a means
of learning. For more information, see https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/!
There are 20 main games, but many more in that list. Below is a checklist of what I have done!
There are no guarantees that I will finish all of these
